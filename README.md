# PyMySQL - Connecting Python and SQL for Data Science
## Easily access MySQL databases and execute SQL queries in Python

Link to Medium article: *Coming Soon*

## Context
- SQL and Python are indispensable tools for data practitioners to work effectively with data. 
- A common use case would be the retrieval of data from relational databases using SQL queries, followed by manipulation and analysis of the data in Python with libraries such as pandas.
- But did you know that these two seemingly isolated tasks can be combined into a single Python script to deliver the same outcome more easily?
- In this project, we discover the concepts and implementation of PyMySQL for connecting to and interacting with MySQL databases from Python.
